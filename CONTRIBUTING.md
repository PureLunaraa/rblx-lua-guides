Please take a minute to read through the guidelines below to make sure your contributions fit well with the project.

## How to Contribute

### Fork the Repo
To start, you'll need to fork this repository to your own GitHub account. This will let you make changes on your own copy without affecting the original project.

1. Visit the [**rblx-lua-guides** repository](https://github.com/random19213/rblx-lua-guides).
2. Click the **Fork** button in the top-right corner.

### Create a New Branch
Once you've forked the repo, create a new branch for your changes. This keeps your work organized and makes it easier to submit your PR.

Run this in your terminal or Git client:
```bash
git checkout -b your-branch-name
```

### 3. Make Your Changes
Now it's time to get your hands dirty! Here’s what you can contribute:
- Add a new tutorial or guide
- Improve the clarity of existing tutorials
- Fix typos or grammatical errors
- Update outdated content

### Commit Your Changes
After you’ve made your changes, commit them with a meaningful message that explains what you did. This helps the team understand the changes you made.

Use this command:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add tutorial on XYZ"
```

### Push Your Changes
Once your commit is ready, push it back to your forked repo.

```bash
git push origin your-branch-name
```

### Create a Pull Request
Now that your changes are pushed, it’s time to open a pull request (PR) to merge them into the **main** branch.

1. Go to the [Pull Requests tab](https://github.com/random19213/rblx-lua-guides/pulls).
2. Click **New Pull Request**.
3. Select your branch and submit the PR!

### Review Process
Once your PR is up, the maintainers will review your changes. If everything looks good, it will get merged. If there’s something to adjust, we’ll ask you to make changes before we merge it in.



## Guidelines for Contributions

To make sure everything stays consistent and smooth, here’s what we ask from contributors:

### Code Style
- Use **Roblox Lua** conventions, and pick descriptive names for variables and functions.
- Stick to **tabs** for indentation.
- Comment tricky parts of the code to explain the logic where necessary.

### Documentation Style
- Write tutorials and guides that are easy to follow, with a clear structure.
- Break down long paragraphs into smaller chunks to improve readability.
- Use headings, bullet points, and other formatting tools to organize the content.

### No Breaking Changes
- If you're adding something new, make sure it won’t break anything that’s already working.
- If you’re updating a tutorial or guide, test it out and make sure everything still works.

### Testing
- If your contribution involves code, test it in Roblox Studio before submitting.
- It's always a good idea to test your changes in a small project to make sure it runs smoothly.



## A Few Extra Notes

- Be sure to check the open issues and pull requests before jumping in, just to avoid duplicating work.
- If you're unsure about anything, feel free to open an issue or reach out to the maintainers. We’re happy to help!
